# .dotfiles
> ~/ sweet /~
This is mine dotfiles setup.

## Setting up
`stow` is used to symlink everything in place.
For making things easier, the `./configs/setup.sh` is a convient script to run `stow`:
```bash
cd ./configs && ./setup.sh
```

## nvim setup
This is where most of my changes happen. I'm ALWAYS experiment with my nvim setup.

## TODO
- [ ] Create a ansible playbook to install things (at least for MacOS)
- [ ] Review nvim setup
- [ ] Document this better xD
